  **Token Bucket (Recommended!)**
  Think of it like a gumball machine:
  • Gumballs = tokens = emails you can send
  • Machine adds 1 gumball/second
  • Can hold up to 10 gumballs
  • Want to send email? Need a gumball!
  
  Why it's great:
  • Handles bursts nicely
  • Smooth and fair
  • Production favorite

  Like a gym membership:

  Watch out:
  ⚠ Can send 120 emails in 1 minute
  (60 at 11:59, 60 at 12:00)
